# About Me
As a kid, Crystal spent a lot of time on Neopets (a website  in the early '00s where you have a virtual pet) and really liked changing up her profile but didn’t like any of the existing profile templates. So, she learned some basic HTML to create her own custom profiles. 15 years later in the real world, Crystal was the first support representative at a fintech startup  She spent a lot of time  debugging technical problems with the APIs. Unfortunately, Crystal was passed up for a promotion because she didn't have a technical education. 
This was a wakeup call for Crystal as understood that continuing her former interest would be a good way to open up her  career opportunities. She left her job shortly after pursue software engineering.
